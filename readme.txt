According to the company policy, I can't describe any professional task on which I work. But I have a personal project to describe this here. I have created a small Customer Management System on which I use ASP.NET (MVC) and Entity Framework.

This is a Customer Management System where we can systematically save our clients' information. The scenario of this project is: A company has many employees or agents. Agents are responsible to do the work received from clients. When we save clients' information, the item Agent, Status, and Source have come from the dropdown, and when they inserted we find agent, status, and source with a different color. This color is used to get the concept of the progress of work easily. And another issue is when the project deadline is over, the end date is marked with red color.

In the navigation menu, we can see 4 tab. These are :

1) Client
2) Agent
3) Source
4) Status

Client Information are added such as :

Name : ....................
Email : ....................

.............................................................................
